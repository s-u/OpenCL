NEWS for the OpenCL package

0.1-3	(under development)
    o	fix a bug causing device enumeration to use the default
	device for device count regradless of the specified type.
	This affects only systems with more than one type of device.
	(Thanks to Valerio Aimale for reporting)

    o	added dim argument to oclRun() which allows multidimensional
	indexing (up to 3d) in the kernel. The dimensions can be
	obtained in the kernel via get_global_size() and the index
	values with get_global_id(). Note that using index vectors
	instead of multidimensional indexing may perform better
	depending on the device. The default is to use single
	dimension (dim=size) which is the same as previous versions of
	OpenCL.

    o	add precision="best" in oclSimpleKernel which switches
	automatically to double-precision if supported by the device

0.1-2	2012-03-07
    o	add the support for asynchronous calls, i.e., execution
	parallel to the CPU or multiple parallel GPU operations.
	This is done by using x <- oclRun(..., wait=FALSE) to
	dispatch the kernel and then oclResult(x) to collect the
	results later.

    o	minor cleanup


0.1-1	2011-08-09
    o	improve memory management and clean up on error in oclRun()

    o	use CL_MEM_USE_HOST_PTR instead of clEnqueueWriteBuffer() for
	better performance on large input vectors

    o	add support for native single precision representation
	(see ?clFloat and native.result argument in oclRun())

    o	added INSTALL file with links to common OpenCL implementations


0.1-0	2011-08-08
    o	first public release

	includes support for single and double precision computations
	as well as simple kernels (one output vector, arbitrary input)
